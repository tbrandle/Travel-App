## Reflection
TravelDen is the app I chose to build for my Module 3 capstone project. The project was an individual project and was an idea that I had wanted to build for a long time, but didn't have the skills to do it before Turing. Project goals included learning how to build basic backend data structures and user objects with oAuth. The app was built with React with Router 4, Redux, and firebase.
