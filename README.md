## Reflection
This project was an idea that I had wanted to build for a long time, but didn't have the skills to do it before Turing. I chose to build this app for my personal project for Turing.  We had a week and a half to build. Project goals included learning how to build basic backend data structures and user objects with oAuth. The app was built with React with Router 4, Redux, and firebase.
