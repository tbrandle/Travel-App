## TravelDen
TravelDen is short for Travel Denver and is designed for mobile. TravelDen is a way to share themed itineraries for people visiting Denver. A user can create an itinerary of activities they feel someone visiting (that has the same interests) must see. A visitor can log in, search different itineraries, like an itinerary, and favorite an itinerary. 

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. There is working functionality of user sign in, adding/viewing itineraries, liking and favoriting. Currently working on building app in React Native. This will be deployed on firebase when ready.

## Reflection
TravelDen is the app I chose to build for my Module 3 capstone project. The project was an individual project and was an idea that I had wanted to build for a long time, but didn't have the skills to do it before Turing. Project goals included learning how to build basic backend data structures and user objects with oAuth. The app was built with React with Router 4, Redux, and firebase.
